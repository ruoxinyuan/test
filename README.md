# Dynamic Prediction Framework for CPS Process Data  

This repository contains the implementation of the framework presented in our paper **"Statistical Analysis of Complex Problem-Solving Process Data: A Framework for Dynamic Prediction Using Probability Curves."**  
It provides tools for analyzing CPS process data, fitting probability curves, and evaluating prediction models.  

---

## Features  
- Implements logistic regression, GRU, LSTM, and transformer models for CPS analysis.  
- Fits model outputs using B-splines for model-free probability curve estimation.  
- Includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts.  
- Tested on PISA 2012 problem-solving log file data.

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8 or above  
- Recommended environment: Conda or virtualenv  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cps-prediction.git
   cd cps-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

---

## Quick Start  
### Example: Train a Transformer Model  
Run the following command to train a transformer model on sample data:  
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --model transformer --data data/sample.csv
```  
After training, the probability curve will be saved in the `results/` folder for analysis.
